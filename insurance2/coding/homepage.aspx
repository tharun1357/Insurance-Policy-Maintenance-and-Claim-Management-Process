						Critical Tips For All Types Of Insurence (When Disaster Strikes) Car, travel, 
						health, life, home, auto, business, motor... In our rush to submit our insurace 
						claim for loss or damage to your property, baggage, or holiday we can easily 
						make all kinds of mistakes. These insurance errors cost time and money and 
						could even result in the claim being rejected, so here are some benefits and 
						tips to help both you and the insurence companies.
						<li>
							Get more than one insurnace quote for repairs. Try to use a local contractor 
							with a good reputation. Often when a contractor hears that it is an insuranc 
							claim they will bump up the price, which could affect your claim. So the extra 
							time spent on finding a reputable company is worth it. Don't agree to a final 
							insurance claim settlement until you are satisfied that it is fair.
